## 📦 What Was Created

### Docker Files
- ✅ `receipt_processor/Dockerfile` - Rust backend container
- ✅ `receipt_processor/.dockerignore` - Build optimization
- ✅ `frontend/Dockerfile` - Next.js frontend container  
- ✅ `frontend/.dockerignore` - Build optimization

### Compose Files
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Full production stack
- ✅ `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Database tools only

### GitHub Workflows
- ✅ `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` - Backend CI/CD
- ✅ `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml` - Frontend CI/CD

Both workflows now have:
- ✅ **Staging deployment** - Runs on `dev` branch
- ✅ **Production deployment** - Runs on `main` branch

### Documentation
- ✅ `START_HERE.md` - Your roadmap
- ✅ `QUICK_START_CI.md` - Get pipelines running in 5 min
- ✅ `PIPELINE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_REF.md` - One-page deployment reference
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Full deployment guide
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - What you asked for
- ✅ `WHY_DOCKER_COMPOSE.md` - Explains Tilt vs Docker
- ✅ `README_CI.md` - Overview and reference

### Test Files
- ✅ `receipt_processor/src/lib.rs` - Basic tests for CI

## 🎯 Answer to Your Question

> "How do I push these to production so they go to an actual IP? Can I create a dev pipeline to follow the dev branch and a production pipeline that follows the master branch?"

**YES! Done!** ✅

### Your Setup

| Branch | Environment | Deploys To | When |
|--------|-------------|------------|------|
| `dev` | **Staging** | Staging server | Every push |
| `main` | **Production** | Production server | Every push |

### How It Works

```bash
# Deploy to staging
git push origin dev

# Deploy to production  
git push origin main
```

Both automatically trigger GitHub Actions to test, build, and deploy!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Your Pipelines (5 minutes)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete CI/CD setup with dev/prod pipelines"
git push origin dev
```

Then visit: **GitHub → Actions** to watch them run!

### 2. Deploy to Actual Server (30 minutes)

Read: **[DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_REF.md](DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_REF.md)**

Choose:
- VPS/Server (easiest)
- AWS/GCP/Azure (scalable)
- Railway/Render (quick)
