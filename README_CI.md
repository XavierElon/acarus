## 🎯 What Each Tool Does

### Tilt (You Already Have This)
- ⚡ **Use for**: Active development
- ⚡ **Why**: Hot reload, fast iteration
- ⚡ **Command**: `tilt up`

### Docker Compose (New)
- 🐳 **Use for**: Testing production builds, deployment prep
- 🐳 **Why**: Mirrors production environment
- 🐳 **Command**: `docker-compose up`

### GitHub Actions (New)
- 🤖 **Use for**: Automated testing & deployment
- 🤖 **Why**: Runs on every push, builds images, deploys
- 🤖 **Where**: Automatically in your GitHub repo

## 📊 Pipeline Flow

```
You push code
    ↓
GitHub Actions detects changes
    ↓
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  Backend Changed?          │
└────────────────────────────┘
    YES → Run tests → Build image → Deploy
    NO  → Skip
    ↓
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  Frontend Changed?         │
└────────────────────────────┘
    YES → Lint → Build → Build image → Deploy
    NO  → Skip
    ↓
✅ Success!
```

## 🛠️ What Gets Automated

### On Every Push

**Backend**:
- ✅ Runs Rust tests
- ✅ Checks code formatting
- ✅ Runs Clippy linter
- ✅ Builds Docker image
- ✅ Pushes to GitHub Container Registry

**Frontend**:
- ✅ Runs ESLint
- ✅ Builds Next.js app
- ✅ Builds Docker image
- ✅ Pushes to GitHub Container Registry

### On Push to `main` Branch

- ✅ Automatically deploys to production (when configured)

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Testing Strategy

**Backend**:
- ✅ Basic unit tests in `lib.rs`
- ⚠️ Clippy warnings don't fail (yet)
- ⚠️ Formatting checks don't fail (yet)
- 💡 Add more tests as you develop

**Frontend**:
- ✅ ESLint runs automatically
- ✅ Build validation
- 💡 Add Jest/Vitest tests when ready

### Deployment Strategy

**Current**: 
- ✅ Images build automatically
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub Container Registry
- ⚠️ Production deployment is manual (commented out)

**To Enable Auto-Deploy**:
1. Configure secrets in GitHub
2. Uncomment deployment sections
3. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for details

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Will this break my existing Tilt setup?**  
A: No! They work together. Use Tilt for dev, Docker for testing/deployment.

**Q: Do I need to set up secrets?**  
A: Not immediately. Only if you want to deploy to production.

**Q: What if tests fail?**  
A: The basic tests I added should pass. See `PIPELINE_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting.

**Q: Can I skip Clippy/formatting checks?**  
A: They're set to non-blocking. Fix them when you're ready.

### Get Support

1. Check the documentation files
2. Look at GitHub Actions logs
3. Review error messages
4. Ask your team
