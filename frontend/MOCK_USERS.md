## üßæ Receipt Data Patterns

Each user has realistic receipt data based on their spending pattern:

- **Business-focused** (Admin): Corporate expenses, professional receipts, business meals
- **Typical** (Test): Mix of personal expenses, everyday purchases
- **Frequent** (Demo): Lots of small transactions, quick purchases
- **Family** (John): Family-oriented spending, larger purchases, kid-friendly merchants
- **Health-conscious** (Jane): Health, fitness, organic, premium wellness products
- **Business-travel** (Manager): Travel, entertainment, business meals, corporate expenses
- **Minimal** (Guest): Very few receipts, simple purchases

// Get receipts by category
const foodReceipts = mockUserReceiptData.getUserReceiptsByCategory('user-2', 'Food & Dining')

// Get recent receipts (last 30 days)
const recentReceipts = mockUserReceiptData.getRecentUserReceipts('user-2', 30)

// Generate all user receipts
const allReceipts = mockUserReceiptData.generateAllUserReceipts()
